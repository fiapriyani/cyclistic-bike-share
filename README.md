## SQL Analysis
The analysis was conducted using SQL in Google BigQuery and structured into three stages:

- **Data Cleaning (`01_data_cleaning.sql`)**  
  Data validation, removal of invalid records, and creation of derived variables such as ride length and day of week.

- **Exploratory Analysis (`02_exploratory_analysis.sql`)**  
  Examination of rider behavior, including ride frequency, average ride duration, and temporal usage patterns.

- **Business Analysis (`03_business_analysis.sql`)**  
  Analysis focused on bike type preference, station popularity, and route behavior to support membership conversion strategies.
